##  Overview

This work explores how incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions through charge distribution modeling affects the performance of equivariant interatomic potentials. The research evaluates three model variants:

- **NequIP**: Standard equivariant message-passing model  
- **NequIP-LR**: Long-range model with charge equilibration  
- **NequIP-NoQeQ**: Long-range model with direct charge prediction  

###  Key Experiments Include:

- Varying total number of model layers  
- Modifying number of charge-encoding layers  
- Tuning the interaction cutoff radius
